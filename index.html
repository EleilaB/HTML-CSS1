                The series starts with Vin, a young orphan girl, who learns to survive on her own in the streets. She has something — a power? — that allows her to influence people’s decisions, but she does not know how to use it and can barely manage to work her magic on a select few.
            </p>
            <p>
Her world turns upside down when she meets Kelsier, a famed hero, who was the only person alive to have survived the torture chambers of The Lord Ruler. What Kelsier teaches her turns into the impossible quest to overthrow their evil overlord who had ruled over the entire planet for a thousand long years.
